## Project Overview
This project contains automated end-to-end tests for the **SwiftTranslator** web application using **Playwright (JavaScript)**.

The assignment includes:
1. **Excel-based (data-driven) automation** – test cases are read directly from the completed Excel file.
2. **Hard-coded automation (backup)** – all test case details are written directly inside the Playwright script to ensure tests can run even if Excel access is unavailable.

Both approaches are provided to ensure **reliability and ease of marking**.
